# static

Type properties and methods are declared using static keyword.
static properties and static methods are queried and set on the type, not on the instances. static properties and static methods can't be overridden by a subclass of the type. These are accessed by using type name followed by dot syntax

```
public class KingfisherManager { 
public static letcshared = KingfisherManager() 
}
KingfisherManager.shared
```
